1.  Introduction

   [RFC1034] and [RFC4592] describe wildcard domain name.

   Nowadays wildcard domain is globally used, especially on CDN, P2P,
   advertise, anti-virus, DNSBLs service.

   Take "*.github.io" for example,

   foo.github.io.      3599    IN  CNAME   github.map.fastly.net.
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A   151.101.0.133
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A   151.101.192.133
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A   151.101.64.133
   github.map.fastly.net.  25  IN  A   151.101.128.133

   Wildcard domain is simple configured on Authoritative Nameserver, but
   Intermediate Nameservers have to cache various domains
   (xxx.github.io, yyy.github.io, ... ) of the same wildcard domain
   configuration.

   Moreover, [DNSNoise] found that many of wildcard domains are
   disposable (short live time), but with low cache hit rate, increase
   cache size.

   This document specifies a new SWILD RR type and describes a wildcard
   detect method for Intermediate Nameservers to cache wildcard domain
   record, in order to reduce the cache size and optimize the wildcard
   domain cache miss.

   It is OPT-IN, Intermediate Nameservers can choose not to implement or
   enable it.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Basic terms used in this specification are defined in the documents
   [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC4592], [RFC7719], [RFC7871] and [RFC8020].

   Authoritative Nameserver: Described in [RFC1035] Section 6.

   Intermediate Nameserver: Described in [RFC7871] Section 4.

   Recursive Resolver: Described in [RFC1035] Section 7.

   Forwarding Resolver: Described in [RFC2308] Section 1.

3.  The SWILD Resource Record

   The presentation format of the SWILD RR is as follows:

      owner ttl class ALIAS target

   The "target" is a subdomain of the owner, to indicate that all
   subdomains of the "owner" have the same configuration with the
   "target".

4.  Overview

   We use a special character "_" to indicate the wildcard domain
   configuration on Intermediate Nameservers, make all the subdomains
   CNAME to the "_" subdomain, and generate a SWILD RR "_".

   If most of Recursive Resolvers support SWILD RR in the future, the
   wildcard detect method can be deprecated on the Recursive Resolvers,
   "_" special character is not stricted use for SWILD subdomain name.

   Take "*.foo.com" for example.

4.1.  Authoritative Nameserver

   Authoritative Nameserver configures the zonefile of "foo.com":

   1.  add SWILD RR "_" to indicate subdomain wildcard.

   2.  add TXT RR "subdomain_wildcard: _" to indicate subdomain
       wildcard.

   3.  make "*.foo.com" CNAME to "_.foo.com".

   4.  configure "_.foo.com".

   Note that, there is not any other subdomain configured in the
   "foo.com" zone except "_.foo.com".

   $ORIGIN  foo.com.

   @    86400  IN   SWILD  _
   @    86400  IN   TXT    "subdomain_wildcard: _"
   _     3600  IN   CNAME  map.bar.net.
   *      600  IN   CNAME  _

4.2.  Intermediate Nameserver: Recursive Resolver

4.2.1.  Get Subdomain Wildcard Response

   Recursive Resolver sends "xxx.foo.com" A RR query to Authoritative
   Nameserver, get dns response: "xxx.foo.com" CNAME to "_.foo.com".

   xxx.foo.com.    600 IN  CNAME   _.foo.com.
   _.foo.com.     3600 IN  CNAME   map.bar.net.
   map.bar.net.    600 IN  A       202.38.64.10
   foo.com.      86400 IN  SWILD   _.foo.com.

4.2.2.  Recursive Resolvers that support SWILD RR

   Recursive Resolver knows that SWILD RR is for wildcard domain on
   recursive side, marks "_.foo.com" as wildcard domains of "*.foo.com".
   The next time, Recursive Resolver receives a "yyy.foo.com" A RR
   query, it can directly return a wildcard CNAME as response.

   yyy.foo.com.    600 IN  CNAME   _.foo.com.
   _.foo.com.     3600 IN  CNAME   map.bar.net.
   map.bar.net.    600 IN  A       202.38.64.10
   foo.com.      86400 IN  SWILD   _.foo.com.

4.2.3.  Recursive Resolvers that not support SWILD RR, but support
        wildcard detect method

   Recursive Resolver knows that "_" is special character for wildcard
   domain on recursive side, and sends a "foo.com" TXT RR query to
   Authoritative Nameserver, get dns response: foo.com subdomain is
   wildcard.

   foo.com.        86400   IN  TXT "subdomain_wildcard: _"

   Recursive Resolver marks "_.foo.com" as wildcard domains of
   "*.foo.com".  The next time, Recursive Resolver receives a
   "yyy.foo.com" A RR query, it can directly return a wildcard CNAME as
   response.

   yyy.foo.com.    600 IN  CNAME   _.foo.com.
   _.foo.com.     3600 IN  CNAME   map.bar.net.
   map.bar.net.    600 IN  A       202.38.64.10

4.2.4.  Recursive Resolvers that not support neither SWILD RR nor
        wildcard detect method

   Recursive Resolver can deal dns response as usual.

   The next time, Recursive Resolver receives a "yyy.foo.com" A RR
   query, it can send dns query to Authoritative Nameserver.

4.3.  Intermediate Nameserver: Forwarding Resolvers

   Forwarding Resolver sends query to its next-hop Resolver is similar
   to Recursive Resolver sends query to Authoritative Nameserver.

5.  DNS Cache

   Intermediate Nameservers' cache size can be reduced, avoid to cache
   various domains of the same wildcard domain configuration.

   Intermediate Nameservers' cache hit rate can be rised, avoid to query
   Authoritative Nameserver for the same wildcard domain configuration.

6.  DNSSEC

   Clients can use DNSSEC to validate the response with the
   Authoritative Nameserver.

   DNSSEC-Enabled Intermediate Nameservers that support wildcard detect
   method can save cost, only validating the SWILD/TXT RRSIG of
   "foo.com" and the RRSIGs of "_.foo.com".

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks a lot to all in the DNSOP, DNSPRIV and DNSEXT mailing list.
